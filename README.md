I recreated user flows for the onboarding process, saving an item, and organizing an item tasks of 3 competitors in the cloud storage space. After analyzing the flows that our competitors use, I designed user flows for those same tasks for Remkeep using some similar elements observed in the competitors' flows in order to create a sense of familiarity for users.
